## Clock

The clock project is meant to be used in an alarm clock that fits into a pillow, and uses vibrations rather than sound to wake the user.
The user can set the time until the alarm sounds using a potentiometer, and the program wil display the time remaining until the user is to be woken up.
After the time has expired, the program will make a vibration motor vibrate every two seconds until the use presses a button to snooze the device.
